I made this project to accurately predict people's facial emotions. I yielded over 80% testing accuracy, please follow the repo step by step to get similar results. I also created code where it would display inside out characters beside the box according to the highest scoring emotion just for fun. haha

I used the datasets of the FER2013 and FER2013plus to obtain a better accuracy result. 
The FER2013plus dataset is better than the FER2013 since the emotions are soft-labeled. Meaning each image has a probability distribution over multiple emotions. This allows machine learning to capture the ambiguity about the image emotion better.

If you want to yield similar results to this project, I suggest downloading the 2 datasets before continuing.

FER2013.csv = This file contains only 7 emotions which are happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and neutral
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FER2013plus = This file has additional emotions called "contempt". On top of that, the emotion scores for each image are distributed. Meaning that there will not be a definite emotion.

For Example, this is the FER2013 labels:

While this is the FER2013plus labels:

I will be using pytorch and CNN neural network models since it is best for reading images.

Here are the examples of the output:

| Contempt | Neutral | Joy | Sad |
|----------|---------|-----|-----|
| ![Contempt](images/Output/Contempt.png) | ![Neutral](images/Output/Neutral.png) | ![Joy](images/Output/joy.png) | ![Sad](images/Output/sad.png) |


It also tracks multiple faces :

Not too shabby if you ask me ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜­ðŸ’ª
